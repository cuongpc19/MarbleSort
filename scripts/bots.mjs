 *
 * ⚠ The weights in `open` are 10 against 1, which is the whole problem: a box with three holes
 * and three matching marbles already on the belt needs nothing, and still scores 30 - 3 = 27 —
 * comfortably the highest on the board. So the bot tips nine more marbles for a colour with no
 * room left and they ride the belt forever. `net` sees that need as 0, and gets the follow-on
 * free: once the committed marbles will fill the box, that box clears and its colour stops being
 * on top, so there is nothing left to aim at. Measured over 29 levels, best play went 78% -> 95%.
 *
 * ⚠ The trailing terms in `net` only decide ties and getting them wrong is expensive. Scoring
 * `need * 10 - sent` alone prefers a colour with **no box open at all** (0 - 0) over one with a
 * hole left and three marbles already coming (0 - 3), so a quarter of all its taps went to
 * colours nothing could accept — level 8 fell from 100% to 65%. Rewarding "has somewhere to go"
 * first and penalising over-supply second put the average at 95% with no level under 50%.

 * half is exactly what an open box wants reads as worthless, and one whose right half is a colour
 * nothing can accept reads as a clean move.
