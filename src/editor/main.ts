/**
 * Arranging the well by hand.
 *
 * The stacks are normally *derived* — `search` builds ~10 candidate layouts, scores each with bot
 * games and keeps whichever lands nearest the slot's target. That is the right default and it is
 * not a design tool: a designer who wants this colour third and that one last has no way to say so.
 * Dragging a box says it.
 *
 * ⚠ **A hand-arranged order is a pinned order.** `Blueprint.columns` is what carries it, and from
 * then on `toLevelDef` skips the search entirely — the board no longer rebuilds itself against the
 * slot it sits in, which is exactly what pinning is for and exactly what makes it a commitment. The
 * label above the well says which state it is in and offers the way back.
 *
 * ⚠ **The line has to be re-found on every move.** A pinned board skips `derive`, so nothing
 * produces a `refTaps` for it — and `Blueprint.refTaps`' own note says a level with no line is one
 * every tool reports as unsolvable, with `hint()` degraded to the first tappable cell it can see.
 * So each drop calls `lineFor` for the new stacks. If that comes back empty the arrangement is kept
 * (the designer is mid-thought) and the panel says so as a **fatal** issue rather than the editor
 * silently pinning a board nothing can win.
 *
 * ⚠ Moves only ever *reorder*: a box is spliced out and spliced back in. Adding or dropping one
 * would break the arithmetic every board depends on — each colour needs exactly `TRAY_N /
 * BOX_SLOTS` boxes per tray, and one box too few is a level that cannot be finished by anyone.

 * Keep the box order across a tray edit, instead of deriving a fresh one.

 * ⚠ **Adding a tray used to reshuffle the whole well**, and it looked like a bug because nothing
 * about it is local: the boxes are derived, and `derive` does not extend an arrangement — it builds
 * ~10 fresh candidates from the new drawing, scores each with bot games and keeps whichever lands
 * nearest the slot's target. One new tray is a different drawing, so a different candidate wins and
 * every column is re-dealt. Reported from real use as the order "tự dưng thay đổi".
 *
 * So an edit now **patches** the order it already had: the boxes a colour has gained are appended,
 * the ones it no longer needs are taken away, and everything else stays exactly where it was.
 *
 * ⚠ The multiset is not negotiable — each tray needs `TRAY_N / BOX_SLOTS` boxes of its own colour
 * or the level cannot be finished by anyone — so this fixes the counts and only the counts.
 * ⚠ **Surplus goes from the deepest box up, and new boxes go to the shortest column.** What the
 * player meets first is what the design is about; taking a box off the top would rewrite the part
 * of the level that was already settled, and piling every new box onto one column would bury it.
 * ⚠ Returns null when there is nothing to keep — no previous order, or no trays left — and the
 * caller falls back to a normal derivation.
