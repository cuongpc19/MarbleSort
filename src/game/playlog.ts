// Real games, recorded on the device.
//
// Why this exists: every difficulty number in this project so far comes from a bot, and bots
// are systematically wrong about people. The sibling Pixel Flow project scored five different
// bot models against 67 real games across 21 levels, and **not one of them beat guessing a
// single constant** (log-likelihood -46.4 for the constant; the best model managed -48.6).
// What did work was averaging two oppositely-biased models and bending the result through a
// logistic curve fitted on real games — but that needs real games first, and this file is how
// they get collected.
//
// The build is static (GitHub Pages / a Capacitor APK), so there is no server to post to.
// Runs accumulate in localStorage and Settings copies them out as JSONL, one game per line,
// ready to be pasted straight into `playlog.jsonl` on the dev machine.
