// Same lesson as `scripts/bots.mjs`: one definition, imported, or the tooling optimises something
// the game is not running.
//
// It lives in its own file rather than in `custom.ts` because that file is deliberately free of
// the generator — the editor imports it and must not pull the difficulty ladder in with it.
