   *
   * ⚠ **A box and its marbles leave together, or the level becomes unwinnable.** Supply and
   * demand are equal on every board the generator ships: a colour has exactly as many marbles
   * in trays, chute and belt as its boxes have holes. Deleting six marbles to free the rail
   * leaves six holes nothing can ever fill; deleting two boxes leaves six marbles nothing can
   * ever eat. So a revive is one operation — take a box off, take its `BOX_SLOTS` marbles off
   * the belt — and that is what makes "6 marbles and 2 boxes" the same number twice, not two
   * numbers that happen to be quoted together.
   *
   * The order boxes are considered in, which is the design's own:
   * - **Row 2 of the well first** (stack index 1), left to right, then rows 3, 4, … the same way.
   * - The **open box is last** and only while it is still untouched. Taking a box the player has
   *   already put marbles into throws that progress away, and its part-filled holes would make
   *   the marbles-removed count something other than six.
   * - A box only qualifies if its colour has `BOX_SLOTS` marbles **on the belt** — the rail is
   *   what is jammed, and clearing a colour that is still sitting in a tray relieves nothing.
   *
   * Returns null unless a **full** revive is available. Half of one — three slots freed — is not
   * worth the coins and the pop-up should not be offered at all.
