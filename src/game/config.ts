/**
 * The design box is 540 wide and **flexes in height** to the frame it is running in.
 *
 * Why it cannot stay a constant: Phaser's FIT scaler grows the design box until one axis fills
 * the frame, and in any 16:9 frame — which is every iframe size the host uses — that axis is the
 * height. The width is then whatever the ratio leaves: `width = height × (GAME_W / GAME_H)`. At a
 * fixed 1160 that is 0.466, so the game rendered as a 298px ribbon down the middle of a 1243px
 * page while three quarters of the frame sat empty. Nothing had shrunk; a taller, thinner box
 * scaled to the same height is simply narrower.
 *
 * ⚠ **The clamp is what makes it safe, and both ends are measured, not chosen.**
 *
 * `MAX` is today's shape, so a tall phone gets exactly the layout every art decision was made
 * against — this must not become a redesign of the phone build.
 *
 * `MIN` is where the machine physically ends: `L.machine.y + L.machine.h` = 1066, plus a 14px
 * skirt. Everything below that was empty violet. Going tighter would mean cutting real content,
 * and the only content left to cut is load-bearing — the chute is 186px at a 33° cone and
 * shortening it stops the marbles sliding (see the note on `funnel`), and the grid is five rows
 * at pitch 71.
 *
 * ⚠ So the flex is 1080…1160, worth about 7% on a desktop frame and nothing at all on a phone.
 * Matching the sibling project's 0.625 would need `GAME_H` near 864, which is less than the grid
 * and the chute alone — that is a second layout (the box well beside the machine rather than
 * under it), not a number.
 *
 * ⚠ Read **once**, at module load. A mid-session resize does not re-run it: the Phaser canvas is
 * built from this value, so changing it later would mean rebuilding the game. Rotating a phone
 * keeps the shape it booted with, which is the same behaviour the sibling project ships.
 *
 * ⚠ The `typeof window` guard is not defensive dressing — `logic.ts` and `level.ts` import this

 *
 * ⚠ **This is the whole of the desktop win, and it is not cosmetic.** `GAME_H` cannot be shorter
 * than the machine's own bottom edge, and Phaser's FIT scaler sets the canvas width from the design
 * box's aspect — so 84px of empty row cost the desktop build 84px of height it then paid for in
 * width. With the row present the flex range collapsed to a single value (1164…1164) and the
 * desktop canvas sat at 288px of a 1258px page; without it the range is 1080…1164 again and the
 * canvas is 311px. A tall phone is unaffected either way: at 2.16:1 it takes `H_MAX` and always
 * did.
 *
 * ⚠ Applied to the constants, not to a container. Every consumer reads `L` — the art, the Matter
 * funnel walls, the belt path, the pointer-to-cell mapping — so moving the numbers moves all of
 * them together. Shifting a render container instead leaves the physics and the hit tests behind
 * at the old offset, and the marbles drift out of the funnel they are supposed to be inside.
 * ⚠ The cabinet keeps its height and rides up **whole**. Growing `machine.h` to keep its bottom
 * edge pinned was tried first and it just moved the hole: the well got 84px taller while still
 * drawing `BOX_VISIBLE` = 5 boxes, so the empty strip reappeared inside the well. Stretching one
 * end of the machine to hide a gap at the other end is the original defect upside-down. The whole
 * block moves, and the background shows below it — which is what a machine standing on a floor
