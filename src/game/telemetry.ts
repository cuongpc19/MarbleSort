// Finished games, sent to a Firebase Realtime Database — the only route real players' results
// have to reach us.
//
// Why it exists: `playlog.ts` writes every game to localStorage, on the player's own machine, and
// Settings can copy them to the clipboard. That works for the person holding the phone and for
// nobody else. `npm run winrate -- --fit` needs games from strangers, and until this file existed
// there was no way to get one.
//
// ⚠ **Realtime Database, not Firestore.** RTDB accepts raw JSON over REST — one `fetch`, no SDK,
// **zero bytes** added to the bundle. Firestore's REST API wraps every field in its own type
// ({"integerValue":"30"}…), so it needs a conversion layer at both ends for the same result.
//
// ⚠ **The database URL is exposed in the bundle** and there is no way around that for
// browser-sent telemetry. So the security rules must make `/runs` **write-only** — anyone may add
// a row, nobody may read one back. See `database.rules.json`.
//
// ⚠ **The privacy page has to agree with this file.** `public/privacy.html` names what is
// collected; the moment a field is added here that page is wrong, and CrazyGames requires it to
// be right. They are two files rather than one only because one is HTML.
//
// Reading the data back: `node scripts/pull-runs.mjs` (see that file).

 * against 26,774 rows that are otherwise about 200 bytes each. `public/stats.html` reads none of
 * it, and the Realtime Database's REST API has **no way to ask for a row without one of its
 * fields**, so every byte of it was downloaded and thrown away. Measured on a phone: the dashboard
 * stopped loading at all, because the window had grown past what Safari will parse in one go.
 *
 * ⚠ **A separate node, not deleted.** A replay is the only way to watch a game somebody actually
 * lost instead of guessing at it (`scripts/replay.mjs`), and nothing was wrong with keeping it —
 * only with keeping it where the dashboard had to walk past it.
 *
 * ⚠ **The row is the run row plus `rep`, not a new shape.** `sendRun` sends one object to two
 * places and the only difference is that field, so a field added to a game row lands in both
 * without anybody remembering to. `replay.mjs` reads `lvl`, `sig`, `result`, `ms`, `taps`, `peak`

 * "this device reached level 1 at this time" — and nothing about whether they tapped once, ten
 * times, or never touched the screen. Measured over five hours: 33 abandoned entries, **88% of them
 * never sent another row from that device again**. That is people leaving the game for good at the
 * first board, and it is the largest single loss in the funnel; it cannot be worked on blind.
 *
 * ⚠ **Sent on `pagehide` / `visibilitychange`, with `keepalive`** — the same mechanism the end row
 * already relies on to escape a closing tab. If the browser is killed outright nothing is sent and
 * we are exactly where we were, so this can only ever add information.
 *
 * ⚠ **Its own node, and level 1 only.** The dashboard pulls `/runs` whole on every load, and this
 * project has just spent a day undoing the last field that made that query heavy — `rep` was 61% of
