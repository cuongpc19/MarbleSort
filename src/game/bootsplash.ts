 * Take down the HTML boot poster in `index.html`.
 *
 * ⚠ **Every scene that can be the first one on screen has to call this**, not just Home. The
 * poster is a full-screen `div` at `z-index: 10`, so whatever fails to dismiss it does not
 * degrade — it covers the running game completely, and the player is left looking at a title
 * that pulses forever over a board they cannot see or touch.
 *
 * That is exactly what `?level=N` and `?custom=1` did: `main.ts` stops Home and starts Game
 * directly, so `HomeScene.create` — the only place that used to remove the poster — never ran.
 * Reported from a phone as "chỉ hiển thị Ball Flow rồi mãi không play được", and it took the
 * request log to find, because every URL anyone tested from a desktop went to `/` and worked.
 * The editor's two "open the game" links are `?level=N` and `?custom=1`, so every hand-built
 * board previewed that way had been showing a dead poster too.
 *
 * Idempotent, so calling it from a scene that restarts costs nothing.

 * Paint the page behind the canvas.

 * ⚠ Not decoration. Phaser's FIT scaler keeps the 540-wide design box's aspect, so on a 16:9 desktop
 * frame roughly three quarters of the window is page rather than canvas — the bars are the larger
 * surface, and a colour that disagrees with the scene reads as the game sitting in a hole.
 *
 * ⚠ Per scene, because the two screens do not share a background: Home is flat dark violet, the
 * board runs a gradient into a much lighter violet at its foot. One CSS value has to be wrong on one
 * of them, and the wrongness lands exactly where the eye checks — the corner where bar meets canvas.

 * the canvas is about a quarter of the width and the other three quarters are this. A flat field
 * that size does not read as a background, it reads as a game that failed to fill its window.
 *
 * ⚠ Nothing here can make the game *bigger* — that is set by the design box's aspect and the
 * machine's own height, and the vertical budget was measured with no slack left in it. What this
 * does is make the space around it deliberate: a pool of light where the machine stands, falling
 * away to a darker edge, so the eye is sent to the middle instead of to the emptiness.
