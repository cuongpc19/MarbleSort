/**
 * Send a player who has not cleared level 1 yet **straight onto the board**, skipping the home
 * screen and its PLAY button.
 *
 * ⚠ **Every new player goes through level 1** — 2527 of 2585 devices over seven days started there,
 * and the other 2% are returning players resuming deeper in. So the PLAY tap is a gate that every
 * single new player passes through exactly once, and nothing before it is measurable: the log's
 * first row is written when a *board* is entered, so anyone who loads the game, looks at the home
 * screen and leaves is invisible to every number this project has. That gate has already cost a
 * whole audience once — PLAY once sat 34px below the bottom edge of the canvas in the CrazyGames
 * desktop frame, and the game looked launched and could not be started, with no row to say so.
 *
 * ⚠ **Only until level 1 is cleared** (`save.unlocked === 1`), not for ever. The home screen is
 * where the wallet, the settings and the daily reward live, and a win routes the player back to it
 * deliberately. Skipping it permanently would delete a feature; skipping it once removes a tap
 * nobody is there for. A player who fails level 1 and comes back still skips it, which is the case
 * this is most for.
 *
 * ⚠ They can still reach it: the win card, the lose card and the pause menu all carry HOME.

 * DevTools console — and the way this project resets between playtests.
 *
 * ⚠ **It must run after `platform.init()`, and it did not.** As a top-level IIFE it ran before the
 * CrazyGames SDK had loaded, so `sdk` was still null inside `platform.storage.removeItem` and the
 * host branch was a silent no-op — `localStorage` was cleared and the host store was not. `getItem`
 * reads the **host store first**, so every value came straight back and the reset appeared to do
 * nothing. Reported as "k được" on a build where it demonstrably worked with seeded local keys,
 * because seeding by hand writes only the local store and never reproduces it. Progress earned by
 * *playing* goes through `save.ts` into both.
 *
 * ⚠ **Clear `SAVE_KEYS`, not the keys `localStorage` happens to hold.** A player arriving on a new
 * device has their cloud save in the host store and nothing local at all, so the enumeration finds
 * nothing to delete.
 *
 * ⚠ Nothing may read progress before this, which is the same rule `platform.init()` already has —
 * `save` is all getters, and the Phaser game does not exist yet when this runs.
