   * so anything drawn across the box row or the belt hides the next marble arriving — the player
   * is congratulated by having the thing they are playing taken off screen. The cabinet's
   * shoulders are the only strip of the machine nothing is ever read off, which is exactly what
   * makes them the place to put this.
   *
   * ⚠ **Three shells a side**, not one big burst. Depth is what makes it read as a display rather
   * than a pop, and the win screen is still where the budget goes (`confetti`, the star pops).
   *
   * ⚠ It grows **upward and in count, never wider.** The launch sits 34px in from the cabinet edge
   * and the sparks already reach within a few pixels of the canvas on both sides, so scaling the
   * horizontal throw is how this starts getting cropped by the screen — and a firework clipped by
   * the screen edge reads as a rendering fault, not as a firework. More shells, a bigger ring, more
   * and larger sparks, a longer fall: all free. A wider `far`: not.
   *
   * ⚠ It runs about 1.7s, and the length lives in the **stagger and the falling embers**, not in
   * the climb. Slowing the rocket to fill the same time makes it read as sluggish rather than
   * longer — a shell that crawls has not been launched. So the second shell hangs back further
   * and the sparks fall further over more time; the climb is barely touched.
   *
   * Tinted with the colour just eaten plus a deep gold, so the burst points back at what earned it
   * rather than being generic celebration confetti.
   *
   * ⚠ **No additive blending and no pale tones**, which is the whole reason the first version
   * photographed as an empty machine. The rims are part of the cabinet and the cabinet is *white*;
   * a gold spark on ADD over white is white, so the effect ran perfectly and could not be seen.
   * Same trap the box-clear burst is tinted out of, met on a lighter surface still. Saturated fill,
   * and a ring rather than a flash for the pop — an outline survives a light ground, a glow does not.
